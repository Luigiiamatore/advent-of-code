# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

My solutions in **Java** for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## 🧩 Project Structure

The project is structured to separate logic from data:

* `src/main/java/aoc/year2025/`: Contains the daily solutions (`DayXX.java`).
* `src/main/java/aoc/Solution.java`: Base class handling input loading and timing.
* `inputs/`: Local folder (ignored by Git) containing puzzle inputs.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create an `inputs/2025/` folder in the project root.
3.  Download your daily input from the official site and save it as `dayXX.txt` (e.g., `day01.txt`).
4.  Run the corresponding `DayXX` class from your IDE.
